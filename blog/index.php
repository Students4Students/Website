On the 20th of April, Alex Astley, an ex-Verulam Student who now attends Oxford University, won the Adrian Evans award which was presented to him by The Princess Royal. The award, which is sponsored by Lattitude Global Volunteering, recognises dedication to continued volunteering and was given to Alex for his recent work in co-founding the educational charity Students4Students. The award also included a &pound;400 prize fund which goes towards the charity. In addition to the Adrian Evans award Students4Students was also a finalist in the O2 ThinkBig challenge where they were awarded &pound;300. 
</p><p>
Alex co-founded Students4Students with Will Clare after they returned from a three month volunteer placement in Ghana in the summer of 2014. The charity empowers young people, those aged between 16-25, to become volunteer tutors for primary school children who are at risk of not fulfilling their potential. The tutors work with the pupils on a one-to-one basis in either maths or English for an hourly session once a week. The charity currently works with two schools in the Oxford area but is already looking to expand, including into the St.Albans district. 
</p><p>
When asked for his reaction on winning the award Alex said 'It was fantastic to meet The Princess Royal and have all the work that  Will, myself and all of the volunteers have put in recognised. The prize fund will certainly help us to achieve our aims and hopefully allow us to expand and help more children.' However it was not just Alex who was enthused about the whole event. The Princess Royal also had some very insightful words to say, including this quote that truly epitomises the focus of Students4Students:

To everyone sitting exams or assessments,
</p><p>
We  know how hard you are all working but wanted to remind you of something that we hope you will remember throughout the next few weeks and always; Whatever test or exam you are taking, it can't possibly assess what makes you so special and unique. The people who make these tests and score them do not know you the way your youth workers and teachers do and they certainly don't know you in the way your friends and family do.
</p><p>
They do not know that some of you speak different languages, or that sometimes you volunteer, or that some of you are young carers.  They do not know that you were there for your friend when they were going through a hard time or that you picked up that little animal and moved it to a safer place.
</p><p>
They do not know your natural talent for acting, singing, public speaking or making people laugh. They can't know from the test that people just feel good when you are around...but perhaps you don't know that yet either.
</p><p>
They don't know that your friends count on you and that your smile brightens up so many peoples' day.  They do not know that you are kind and trustworthy and that every day (well most), you do the best that you can do.
</p><p>
For sure exams are important and tell people something about you but they don't tell everything and depending on your perspective, they miss out some of the most important bits! There are many ways of being smart and showing your intelligence so during this intense time of revision and sitting exams, remember there is no way to 'test' all of the amazing and awesome things that make you, YOU!

<p>
Over the last 6 months, co-founders Alex and Will have been challenging themselves to set up a much needed charity here in the UK. Along with the help of a hard-working committee from Oxford University, the charity is off to a fantastic start. Tutoring will begin in a few weeks time in Windale and Windmill Primary schools in Oxfordshire with over 14 trained tutors!
</p><p>
The idea behind Students4Students came about after Alex and Will returned from Ghana in the summer of 2014. Having tutored young school children in Ghana, and seeing the immense impact it had on them, they decided to challenge themselves to bring the idea to the UK in a more structured and precise form. With the number of Primary school students in the UK failing to attain basic literacy and numeracy levels when they reach secondary school, Alex and Will saw how tutoring disadvantaged students one on one could help to improve the standard nationwide. 1.2 million; the number of children leaving primary school without being able to read. This statistic is shocking, and further motivates us to act as quickly as possible.
</p><p>
With their humble beginnings on a plane home from Ghana, Alex and Will have seen unprecedented growth in the charity over the last 6 months. They have been finalists in the O2 Think Big challenge, which Alex attended gaining invaluable knowledge to further improve the charity. And more recently, Students4Students was the receiver of this year's Adrian Evans Award awarded by Ingela Evans, the widow of Adrian (the founder of Lattitude). She recognised the charity's potential and had many a kind word to say on the day. Furthermore, Her Royal Highness Princess Anne was the presenter of the award to Alex and Will, and she had some very insightful words to say, including this quote that truly epitomises the focus of Students4Students:

<p>
Students4Students is in a fantastic position to move forward and continue to grow as we move on into our 7th month. However, we are always looking for more members, tutors, and more pressingly, trustees. We would be humbled if Lattitude Alumni were interested in taking part in our charity and would offer a great deal of experience and training to those who wish to take part. As a trustee you will be a vital member in overseeing the charity's operations, and have a key voice in the expansion and constant revision of the charity's core values.

However, tutoring is relevant not only for academics but also for personal development. A trusted mentor can be pivotal in one's life, providing guidance for one's college applications, career path or simply giving encouragement to go on. 
	</p><p>
The first time I met my mentor was during college. He was my economics professor but over time, we became close and now we frequently chat during evenings about a wide range of topics. Dr. Brown has given me indispensable advice about the optimal path to academic development at my university. However, the most important part of this relationship for me has been the encouragement and trust I have received from my mentor. There were several occasions in college when I felt hopeless and considered myself a mistake of the admission committee, since I was a non-traditional international student. In times like those, the fact that my mentor, who has accomplished all I ever wanted in my life, believed in my capabilities, was essential in me not giving up and letting go of my doubts. 
</p><p>
The uncertainty and hopelessness which I experienced in college is now a known scientific phenomena named "stereotype threat" by Dr. Steele from University of Berkeley. Steele performed experiments with stereotyped groups in the US such as African-Americans and women, who traditionally underperformed on standardized tests. Steele presented the stereotyped groups with a test of logic in two different settings - first, they were said that the test was diagnostic of their intellectual ability and second, that the test was simply a challenging task non-diagnostic of their ability. Steele found that the stereotyped groups performed significantly better given the second set of instructions. Importantly, non-stereotyped groups such as European-Americans were not impacted by the stereotype threat at a statistically significant level. 
</p><p>
Other researchers have found stereotype threat present in settings such as primary schools, between children from lower and higher socio-economic groups. This phenomena can be explained by the fact that if individuals are subconsciously worrying about the negative stereotypes about their group, their full intellectual ability cannot be utilized for a given task. Sadly, it has been shown that stereotype threat not only decreases one's academic performance but also causes an individual to blame themselves for their perceived failures and makes them risk-avoiding. A great mentor can alleviate this problem by repeatedly ensuring the student about their qualities and subsequently building up the student's self-confidence and readiness for challenges. Such mindset is essential for achievement in one's education and further in life.  
</p><p>
Personal development and encouragement offered by a tutor may be just as important as the academic guidance. This is the case because there is a continuous interaction between achievement and personal qualities: success in any field is hardly achieved without sufficient self-belief and the ability and willingness for a challenge.

Lead by the lovely Debi, we learnt a number of teaching techniques to help children to pick up key concepts, and to manage the emotional problems that can often accompany low academic achievement.
</p><img src="/images/page/tutor3.jpg"><p>
The day began with a good dose of science, which helped to provide a real insight into the negative effects of stress on not just mental, but physical health, and the best ways to help struggling students to manage these problems. Just as many students resent the exhausted 'get more sleep and eat better' advice, children struggling in school are also unlikely to be much enamoured with this kind of talk! We learnt about breaking down problems that are stressful into manageable chunks, setting positive goals and writing down positive actions to take in order to overcome stressful situations. It was all very intuitive, and useful not just as part of tutoring, but for managing our own workloads and stress levels as well.
</p><p>
We then moved on to teaching techniques, and cutting-edge research into the best ways to help struggling students to take ownership over their work and achievement, and help them to feel proud of their hard work. We worked on 'breaking the cloud' to understand the links and assumptions behind different problems one by one, breaking what first seemed like a tangled mess of issues into manageable and understandable chunks. Along with two other techniques, and more resources than I can count, our tutors are now well equipped with the tools they need to help students to overcome the challenges they face not just in school, but in life.
</p><p>
One of the most interesting parts of the day related to changing mindsets. Many struggling children may have a 'fixed' mindset, where they feel that success is tied to self-worth, and that they can't do anything to change their own 'intelligence' or 'talent'. We learnt the importance of praising the work put in, and the process of learning, not the outcome or result. This helps students to develop a 'growth' mindset, where hard work is associated with positive outcomes, not the static concepts of 'intelligence' or 'talent'.
</p><p>
For the last part of the day, our Tutor Liaison Officer, James, whipped through the logistics, legalities, and nuts and bolts of tutoring, leaving everyone reassured that they would be well looked after by the committee and our trustees.
</p><p>
It was a great day, and lots of fun for the tutors and committee alike. A huge thank you must go to one of our trustees, Debi, for a great day of training. Thanks also to Alex, Will and James for organising everything. It's full steam ahead to the first tutoring sessions in just a couple of weeks!

Many people are, from personal experience, staunch proponents of the one-on-one tutoring model. Group tutoring sessions faded into educational history long ago as students with private tutors started to leap ahead academically. From personal experience, working with students in both group and private sessions, I can say that the cognitive differences between these two types of tutoring systems are amazing. But what is it that one-on-one tutoring sessions so effective? More importantly, is there any evidence to back up the claim that private tutoring is as effective as many seem to think?</p>

<p>Psychologists and educational institutions have been running experiments to determine just how effective different tutoring methods are. In their 1982 experiment, Cohen, Kulik, and Kulik reported that students receiving one-on-one tutoring outperformed their classmates by about 0.40. The literature suggests that thee is no doubt as to the benefit of one-on-one tutoring. However, determining what makes private tutoring so successful is a much more difficult matter. Clearly many factors are at play when considering the success of these sessions, such as the student, the tutor, the institution, and resources available.</p>

<p>Despite our inability to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes private tutoring so powerful, it is clear that the personalised element is a major factor in its success. In classrooms, students can get left behind as a teacher must move on with the curriculum. Conversely, a student might be bored by the slow pace of the material and cease to pay attention, eventually also falling behind. Teachers are on strict time schedules and whatever pace a teacher moves at is unlikely to march the needs of every single student. Private tutoring, on the other hand, gives the students a chance to express what kind of pacing he or she needs and the tutor can easily personalise.</p>

<p>One of the most effective methods utilised in this type of tutoring is called 'hinting'. Essentially this is a tactic that gives the students a trigger with which they can recall information they already know. By questioning in a variety of ways a tutor gives their pupil many chances to come up with the answer on their own which is often considered on of the best ways to truly retain information.
Although we have yet to prove what exactly makes one-on-one tutoring so effective, it is clear that this is the most efficient type of tutoring. Unfortunately, the biggest downside to one-on-one tutoring is its high cost. Students from lower income families, who would often benefit most from private tutoring, can rarely afford it. Luckily, with groups like Students4Students, more and more pupils will the opportunity to experience the benefits of this type of tutoring.</p>

We were so pleased with the caliber of all of the people who expressed an interest in our project. Once we had received the applications it was time to interview the candidates and it was fair to say they were all a fantastic group.</p>

<p>In the interviews we asked them a selection of questions, including obviously their relevant experience and what they thought they could bring to the team. However more important for us was why they wanted to help us. It is our firm belief that enthusiasm is what differentiates an outstanding volunteer from just a good volunteer.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we know have a fantastic committee who have already achieved so much. All that is left now is to introduce them.</p></div></div>
